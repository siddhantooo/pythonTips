#to flatten a 2-d list use this list comprehension:

def flatten(some2dList):
    return [x for xs in some2dList for x in xs]

# to get the column sum of a rectangular 2-d list:

def colSum(some2dList, col):
    return sum(row[column] for row in data)

# to transpose a rectangular 2-d list:

def transposeList(some2dList):
    numCols = len(some2dList[0])
    return [[row[col] for row in some2dList] for col in range(numCols)]
